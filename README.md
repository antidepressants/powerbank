Some uni project, we're required to build a solar charged battery which charges a phone wirelessly. (Useless project, not worth my time or energy.)

Naturally, I gave minimum effort working on a circuit because that's nerd shit, and I gave minimum effort working on the code because that's also nerd shit.

//Remember to upload circuit later

Code just steps voltage up when it's less than a certain target, and poorly simulates AC by using a H-bridge to turn one pin of the coil on and the other off, then vice versa.

I forgot why I decided not to use a step up converter and decided to make a poor version of my own, but I'll be sure to write it when I remember, or probably change my mind.
