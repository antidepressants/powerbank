Some uni project, solar charged powerbank which wirelessly charges phone. (Useless)

Naturally spent minimum effort on code and circuit, used microcontroller to poorly simulate AC voltage to power coil, very poorly made step up circuit with very poorly written code to control it, poorly written code + voltmeter to stop charging the battery when it's full or when the solar panel isn't outputting high enough voltage, and stuff, can be used for different projects, maybe.

//Remember to upload circuit when you actually draw it
